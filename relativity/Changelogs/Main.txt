* Arrested Development Leaders now only suffer -25% xp gain rather than -100%
* Eager leaders now get +25% xp gain rather than the now-useless recruitment cost reduction.
* upper-tier building costs increased a great deal (now doubles every level) so that it's closer to the actual progression of income - this WILL change later as I get more late-game balance feedback.
* Reworked ground combat and armies. Ground combat will be quite slow early on but will speed up as more powerful units appear, and there is a substantial tech 'gap' now - you do NOT want to be sending regular troops against Space Marines or xenomorphs now.

* Planets can now have 50 armies per planet (you're limited in other ways).
* Now 50 year cooldown on government changes

* Can now attempt integration of upto 5 subjects at once (because you're likey to need to with the above restrictions)
* A bunch of AI work to try and encourage it to build Frontier Outposts more

* Kinetics now have lower energy costs
* autocannons buffed a bit
* Bigger guns now have longer range, lower accuracy and some armour penetration. You'll need big guns to beat enemy big ships because of their disgustingly high health and armouir values. Smaller ships cannot become 'immune' to guns, but can evade better

* Destroyer evasion buffed.
* Dreadnaught evasion nerfed.
* Buffed Health as a portion of military power.

* Removed industry boost tech line (was just causing overcrowding)
* No more free mineral storage from techs. Learn to build silos.
* Orbital hydroponics now produce nutrients rather than consuming it
* Consolidated loads of techs.
* Ships now unlock separately from starports (need the starport tech to unlock the correct ship size tech)
* Advanced pd and defenses will now require better AIs. Best PD now locked to sentient AIs.
